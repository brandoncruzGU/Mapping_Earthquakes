# Mapping Earthquakes

## Challenge Description

This challenge used Leaflet's mapping capabilities to show earthquake data from the past week. We started out with a map of all the earthquakes around the world and then added in two other layers of visual data. The first layer added is the tectonic plates layer and the second layer focuses on the major earthquakes in the past week that have a magnitude of 4.5 or greater. The final component of the challenge asks us to create a third base layer for the map. Our final mapping options include a streets view, a satellite view, and a night mode view. All of these components can be viewed and tested by running the index.html file in the Earthquake_Challenge folder, along with all other project deliverables.
